# cloep
A simple Java command line option event driven parser.

## The goal of this project is to provide
A simple, modern, easy to use parser that processes command line options, in the style of getopt_long(), and maybe some others.

It is an event driven parser, so
* The order of options matter.
* Repetition of options is supported.
